    "text": "Here are some hobby projects I’ve worked on in my spare time.\n\n\n\nA Python port of the c-factor BRDF logic for Google Earth Engine. This algorithm corrects Landsat reflectance data to nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) using fixed, MODIS-derived BRDF spectral model parameters.\nThe Problem: The edges of a Landsat scene have slightly different orientations with respect to the sensors, resulting in “striping” along the WRS2 scene boundaries. This algorithm “flattens” each scene so you can obtain large-area, wall-to-wall composites without variation along the scene boundaries.\nMy Contribution: This is the first publicly available Python port of the c-factor BRDF algorithm. I created a one-to-one comparison with the original JavaScript implementation and verified that this logic produces identical results.\nThe c-factor BRDF algorithm was originally developed by Roy et al. (2016) and implemented in JavaScript by Daniel Wiell and Erik Lindquist of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.\nLinks: - GitHub Repository - Comparison of JS vs Python Outputs - Original JavaScript Implementation\nReference: Roy, D. P., Zhang, H. K., Ju, J., Gomez-Dans, J. L., Lewis, P. E., Schaaf, C. B., … & Kovalskyy, V. (2016). A general method to normalize Landsat reflectance data to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance. Remote Sensing of Environment, 176, 255-271.\nTechnologies: Python, Google Earth Engine, Landsat, MODIS\n\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of my academic publications, please visit my Google Scholar profile.\n\nMore projects coming soon!
