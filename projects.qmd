### C-Factor BRDF Algorithm for Google Earth Engine

A Python port of the c-factor BRDF logic for Google Earth Engine. This algorithm corrects Landsat reflectance data to nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) using fixed, MODIS-derived BRDF spectral model parameters.

**The Problem:** The edges of a Landsat scene have slightly different orientations with respect to the sensors, resulting in "striping" along the WRS2 scene boundaries. This algorithm "flattens" each scene so you can obtain large-area, wall-to-wall composites without variation along the scene boundaries.

**My Contribution:** This is the first publicly available Python port of the c-factor BRDF algorithm. I created a one-to-one comparison with the original JavaScript implementation and verified that this logic produces identical results.

The c-factor BRDF algorithm was originally developed by Roy et al. (2016) and implemented in JavaScript by Daniel Wiell and Erik Lindquist of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
