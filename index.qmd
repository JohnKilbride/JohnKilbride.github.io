## Remote Sensing Scientist

I specialize in mapping and monitoring forest ecosystems using advanced remote sensing technologies and geospatial analysis. My work focuses on understanding forest dynamics, carbon cycling, and ecosystem responses to environmental change.

### Research Focus

- **Forest Ecosystem Monitoring**: Leveraging satellite imagery and LiDAR data to track forest structure and composition
- **Carbon Science**: Quantifying forest carbon stocks and understanding carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Developing innovative methods for analyzing large-scale environmental datasets
- **Climate Change Impacts**: Investigating how forests respond to changing environmental conditions

### Current Work

As a Remote Sensing Scientist at Renoster Systems and Research Assistant at Oregon State University, I develop cutting-edge approaches for monitoring forest ecosystems at scale. I also provide consulting services through Spatial Informatics Group and Pachama Inc., applying remote sensing expertise to real-world conservation and climate challenges.
